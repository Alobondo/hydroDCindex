Description: Compute duration curves of daily flow
              series, both real and modeled, to be compared through indexes of 
              flow duration curves. The package functions include comparative
              plots and goodness of fit tests. Flow duration curve indexes are
              based on: Yilmaz et al., (2008) <DOI:10.1029/2007WR006716>.
